C360NavigationBar
=================

C360NavigationBar is a subclass of UINavigationBar with a solid appearance.  It has two advantages over a stock opaque UINavigationBar:

1. It sets its bar colour based on your window's tintColor, and will dim when your window is dimmed (e.g. by an alert view or action sheet)

2. You can set a separate tintColor for your bar items, allowing the user to tell which elements are tappable.
